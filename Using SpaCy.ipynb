    "# Introduction:\n",
    "Building a resume parser using SpaCy can greatly streamline the process of extracting relevant information from resumes, enabling efficient candidate evaluation. In this guide, we will explore step-by-step instructions to develop a resume parser using the powerful natural language processing library, SpaCy.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Understanding the Problem:\n",
    "Define the objective of the resume parser and the specific information to be extracted, such as name, contact details, skills, education, and work experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Preparing the Environment:\n",
    "Install SpaCy and its required dependencies.\n",
    "Download and load the necessary SpaCy language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Extracting Text from Resumes:\n",
    "Utilize PDF parsing libraries like pdfminer to extract text content from resume files.\n",
    "Implement a function to extract text from PDF files using the chosen library.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Extracting Name from Resumes:\n",
    "Use SpaCy's linguistic capabilities to extract names from resume text.\n",
    "Define name patterns using SpaCy's Matcher module to identify different name formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Extracting Contact Details:\n",
    "Employ regular expressions to extract contact numbers from resume text.\n",
    "Define patterns to capture various phone number formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Extracting Email Addresses:\n",

    "Define email patterns to ensure accurate extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Extracting Skills:\n",
    "Create a predefined list of skills relevant to the desired job requirements.\n",
    "Utilize SpaCy's linguistic capabilities to match and extract skills from the resume text.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Extracting Education:\n",
    "Define a set of education keywords or patterns to identify educational information.\n",
    "Utilize regular expressions to extract education details from the resume text.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Putting it All Together:\n",
    "Combine the individual extraction functions to create a comprehensive resume parser.\n",
    "Process the resume text, extract the desired information, and store it in a structured format.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Enhancements and Customizations:\n",
    "Explore advanced techniques to improve extraction accuracy, such as named entity recognition and entity linking.\n",
    "Consider handling different resume formats and languages for broader compatibility.\n",
    "Implement additional features like extracting work experience, certifications, or personal projects based on specific requirements."
